# 🐣 Cik Wick - Unity

This project is a basic 3D game developed using the Unity game engine. It combines elements such as C# scripting, physics systems, UI, artificial intelligence, and win/loss mechanics to serve as a practical learning experience for game development.

## 🎮 Game Features

This Unity 3D project covers fundamental principles of game development through hands-on examples. Below are the key features included in the project:

### 🔹 Character Control

* Third-person character control with a follow camera.
* Keyboard (WASD) movement and mouse-based look control.
* Basic movement mechanics like jumping and sprinting.

### 🔹 Physical Interactions

* Use of Rigidbody and Collider components for physics-based movement and collisions.
* Interaction with environmental objects (walls, floors, obstacles).
* Accurate simulation of gravity, push forces, and other physical behaviors.

### 🔹 Enemies and AI

* Enemies can detect, follow, and attack the player.
* Navigation controlled by Unity's NavMesh system.
* Basic enemy behavior model (e.g., patrol, chase, attack states).

### 🔹 Health & Timer System

* Health system for the player and a countdown timer.
* Health decreases upon taking damage.
* Triggers a "death" state when health reaches zero or time runs out.

### 🔹 User Interface (UI)

* Health bar, timer display, and score counter.
* Informational UI panels (game over, win, lose screens).
* Interactive menu and restart functionality.

### 🔹 Win & Lose Conditions

* 🥚 To win the game, find all 5 hidden eggs scattered across different corners of the map!

* 🐱 Avoid the enemy cat roaming the kitchen floor — getting caught will end the game.

* 🔥 Watch out for fire bursts coming out of the stoves — touching them will cause damage or lead to death.

### 🔹 Polish (Visual & Audio Enhancements)

* In-game sound effects (hit sounds, death sounds).
* Particle effects (explosions, etc.).
* Visual polish such as camera shake, animations, and lighting.

### 🔹 Extra Features

* Modular structure: Easily extendable with new enemy types or features.
* Code follows SOLID principles.
* OOP architecture ensures clean and maintainable scripts.
